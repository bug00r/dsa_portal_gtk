There no need to use my own resource mechanism because GTK has one :( :

There is a resource way to define standard icon themes :):
    https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/ThemedIcons

    To do so, place your icons in a resource directory structure that matches the hicolor icon theme:

    <gresources>
    <gresource prefix="/my/resources/icons/16x16/actions">
        <file>icon1.png</file>
        <file>icon2.png</file>
        ...
    </gresource>
    </gresources>
    Note that in contrast to the search path example, we don't include 'hicolor' in the path.

    Then, tell GtkIconTheme about the resource path where your icons are located:

    gtk_icon_theme_add_resource_path (gtk_icon_theme_get_default (),
                                        "/my/resources/icons");
